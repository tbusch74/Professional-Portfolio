                <p>My name is Tony Busch and I am a mechanical engineer embarking on a journey to learn web development. During the day I help design and manufacture lifesaving medical devices and in the evening work towards learning the skills of a full stack developer. While some may consider this to be an odd combination, I get the most joy out of my work when I am constantly learning and developing new skills. I’m excited to see what experiences my unique skillset may lead to throughout my career!</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I started my professional training at the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota. I received my bachelor’s degree in biology, was also part of a football team that holds one of the winningest 4 year records in school history and met my now wife Nicole. While not knowing exactly what I would be doing in the future, I knew from the start that I wanted a career where I could help others. The medical field gives that opportunity to directly help others every day. So in 2016 I started an internship at a local medical device contract manufacturer while finishing up my master’s degree in mechanical engineering at St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. I graduated in 2017 and have been in the medical device field ever since.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>This website houses some of my projects that I’ve created as I work my way through the coding boot camp at the University of Minnesota. And while I am currently just learning and not ready to give up my full time engineer role, hopefully one day will contain links to more real life applications that I have had an essential stake in creating. </p>
